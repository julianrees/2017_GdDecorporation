### Data analysis for the Gd-153 decorporation experiment

This repository contains the code used to perform data analysis and plotting for the gadolinium decorporation experiment described by the manuscript ["Evaluating the potential of chelation therapy to prevent and treat gadolinium deposition from MRI contrast agents?" by Julian A. Rees, Gauthier J.-P. Deblonde, Dahlia D. An, Camille Ansoborlo, Stacey S. Gauny, and Rebecca J. Abergel](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-22511-6).  

The R script decorporationData.R was used to process and visualize the data.  The executable R Markdown notebook SI.Rmd was used to generate (via knitr) the file [SI.html](https://julianrees.github.io/2017_GdDecorporation/SI.html), which contains the one-way ANOVA analysis for each sample type.
