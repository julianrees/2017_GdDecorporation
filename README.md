### Data analysis for the Gd-153 decorporation experiment

This repository contains the code used to perform data analysis and plotting for the gadolinium decorporation experiment described by the manuscript "Can chelation therapy brighten the future of gadolinium-based contrast MRI?" by Julian A. Rees, Gauthier J.-P. Deblonde, Dahlia D. An, Camille Ansoborlo, Stacey S. Gauny, and Rebecca J. Abergel.  

The R script decorporationData.R was used to process and visualize the data.  The executable R Markdown notebook SI.Rmd was used to generate (via knitr) the file [SI.html](https://julianrees.github.io/2017_GdDecorporation/SI.html), which contains the one-way ANOVA analysis for each sample type.
